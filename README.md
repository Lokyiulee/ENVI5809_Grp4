# Research Questions
1. How does the change in sea surface temperature and salinity affect coral bleaching rate?

2. How does the change in currents affect coral bleaching rate?

3. How does the change in pH levels affect coral bleaching rate?

# Summary of Analysis
This study analyses the effect of environmental factors, temperature, salinity, pH and current speed on coral bleaching rates in the Great Barrier Reef. Using the visualization of the values by creating colormaps, heatmaps and line graphs, the differences over time regarding bleaching rates and variables were analysed in three locations along the reef in two different time points, 2011 and 2016. A positive relationship was found with bleaching rates while pH showed a negative relationship. Current speed was also founded to have a negative relationship but different than the other variables, presenting a less direct effect to bleaching. The study emphasizes that to reduce the impact of the variables on corals and the ecosystem, integrated regeneration and preservation practices are needed.
